- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Rob Fagg and im a 38 year old aspiring software developer. I'm currently employed full time as a detective constable, working for the Police which I have done for the last 16 years. However, I'm now looking for a career change back into my original passion which is in Software Development. Before joining the Police back in 2005, I had a passion for coding and completed several projects and websites as a freelance web developer, maininy using: (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and SQL with MySQL, plus some VB and C++ mixed in). I'm currently learning the necessary languages, frameworks and workflows to become an effective Full Stack Software Developer and looking to switch careers into Software Development as a Junior Software Developer.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Full Stack Software Development using the latest technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JSX, NodeJS, ReactJS, Bootstrap, C#, Python, PHP, .NET Framework, SQL, JSON, XML and more... I'm also interested in Unity Game Development using C# and have an interest in Machine Learning.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently refreshing my knowledge on the Full Stack of Software Development technologies, which have changed, adapted and developed into much more powerful and versatile languages since I was previously involved in 2005. I'm looking to gain a very good understanding of building web applications with the React JS Framework, and looking to gain a very good understanding of C#.
I'm also brushing up my knowledge around data structures and algorithms, database design, and work with a Test Driven Development metholodology.

- I'm currently in the process of developing a portfolio website where I will showcase the projects that I'm currently working on to display my programming skills and knowledge. Once this is completed I will provide the link in this file...
